## [Version 0.3.2](https://github.com/robweber/omni-epd/compare/v0.3.1...robweber:v0.3.2)

### Changed

- updated Pillow min version to 9.1+
- code cleanup for proper style standards - thanks @missionfloyd

### Added

- added new 4 color waveshare displays (epd1in64g, epd2in36g, epd3in0g, epd4in37g, epd7in3g). Thanks @missionfloyd

## [Version 0.3.1](https://github.com/robweber/omni-epd/compare/v0.3.0...robweber:v0.3.1)

### Added

- `omni_epd.mock` can now set both the width and height values within the `.ini` file. Thanks @missionfloyd

### Fixed

- `omni_epd.mock` device now returns a palette filter when using the color mode. Previously this returned only b/w and resulted in image processing enhancements resulting in a black and white only image, even when color was selected. Hardcoded palette based on web safe colors.

- Waveshare device `epd2in13_V2` should use the alternate clear method which requires a color parameter. Thanks @ThatIsAPseudo for pointing this out

### Changed

- dithering is now done with [didder](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/didder) - this is a massive improvement both in scope and speed to hitherdither. Thanks @missionfloyd

### Removed

- removed `hitherdither` as a dependency

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/robweber/omni-epd/compare/v0.2.6...robweber:v0.3.0)

### Added

- added `force_palette` argument to the `virtualepd._filter()` function. Will force palette based conversion if wanted, default is False
- added additional tested displays per #63 comments
- new unit tests to make sure image processing components run without error
- support for `inky.auto` as a valid EPD device. This will auto detect Inky devices and load the correct driver. Thanks @donbing
- support for IT8951 devices, such as the WaveShare 6in display

### Fixed

- calls to `Image.quantize` require an RGB or L mode Image object, convert any loaded image before applying new palettes
- when filling palette too many colors were being set (< 256), wrong length variable was being used
- fixed regression where Inky `bw` mode was causing colors to be inverted
- universal fix for Waveshare Tri-color displays as original fixes broke some displays - thanks @aaron8684

### Changed

- make sure Pillow and Inky packages are known working versions or above - thanks @donbing
- `bw` standardized as the consistent naming for the default black/white device mode. `black` will throw a warning, affects Inky devices - thanks @missionfloyd

## 0.2.6

### Added

- added `version` identifier for Waveshare devices so that V2 and V3 boards can be identified from the others

### Fixed

- fixed typos in 5.65in Waveshare implementation - thanks @aaronr8684
- fixed issues with BW display on 7.5 tri-color screens - thanks @aaronr8684

### Removed
